This growth is driven by factors such as increased spending on pet healthcare, the introduction of innovative vaccine formulations, and government initiatives promoting vaccination programs against rabies.</p><p>Moreover, the surge in the number of veterinary clinics and hospitals has contributed to improved access to vaccines, further driving market growth. With technological advancements allowing for more effective and long-lasting vaccines, pet owners are more inclined to ensure their pets are immunized.
